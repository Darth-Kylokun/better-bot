# Better Bot
## By Darth-Kylokun
Better Bot compiles code like:
- c++/c
- Python
- Java
- c#
- Node.js

To compile code use the syntax `!!compile {SUPPORTED LANGUAGE}` along with a block of formatted code
## *WARNING*
- For java the main method must be in a class called Rextester
- For c# the entry point for main is `Rextester.Program.Main`
